title: Materials + transport representation in MESSAGEix
description: |-
  These are the data required to parametrize a representation of materials use
  in the transport sector, i.e. the integration of MESSAGEix-Materials and
  MESSAGEix-Transport.

      Even though for this analysis only PHEV and BEVs are relevant, 
      we should probably take into account all powertrain technologies

    description: Battery technology/chemistry that can be used by electric vehicles
    resolution: |-
      Three families of battery chemistries for current fleet of vehicles (NCA, NMC, LFP)
      Possibly, think about two battery chemistries that may be used in the future. Candidates:
        - Li-air
        - Li-S 
  vehicle_segment: 
    scope: size of ELDVs
    description: The vehicle class , which will affect the battery size 
    resolution: |-
      Confirm with Paul which vehicle segments are available in MESSAGEix-Transport
      I suppose: micro, medium, SUV. I might be wrong. To each vehicle segment
      a given battery size has to be assigned, based on current real fleet data
      and then projected until 2050
