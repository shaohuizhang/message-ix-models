    1. The existing task at `key` is moved to a new key, ``{key}+{tag}``.
    2. A new task is inserted at `key` that performs `operation` on the output of the
       original task.

    One way to use :func:`insert` is with a ‘pass-through’ `operation` that, for
    instance, performs logging, assertions, or other steps, then returns its input
    unchanged. In this way, all other tasks in the graph referring to `key` receive
    exactly the same input as they would have previously, prior to the :func:`insert`
    call.

    It is also possible to insert `operation` that mutates its input in certain ways.

    Returns
    -------
    KeyLike
        same as the `key` parameter.
